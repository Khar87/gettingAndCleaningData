Data was created from original Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. 
Steps performed by the script:
  *Read data
  
  *Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  
  #Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  #Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  #Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  #From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
